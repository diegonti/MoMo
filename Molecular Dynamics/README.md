# Molecular Dynamics Code

Fortran programs to perform molecular dynamics of Lennard Jones liquid and Python scripts and notebooks to analyze the data. Files for the Molecular Modelling final task of Block 2.

`FinalPractice-1.f90` and `FinalPractice-2.f90` correspond to the codes used for sections 1 and 2 of the practice. The second is a modified and upgrades version of the first, that includes more subroutines. Performs a MD simulation of Argon for the given input parameters (N, L, $\rho$, ...) (must be changed in the script).

`thermo.ipynb` is a Pyhton notebook that reads and analyzed the output files.

In `/runs1` and `/runs2` are available som examples of different runs and analysis of the part 1 and 2, respectively, of the task.
